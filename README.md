## 🚀 Overview

**Indiverse** cuts through the noise of expensive consultants and unstructured advice. We provide a direct, transparent channel for students to connect with mentors who have "been there, done that."

Unlike traditional agencies that push affiliated universities for commissions, **Indiverse** is built on a community of verified students who offer unbiased, real-world guidance on applications, visas, accommodation, and cultural adaptation.
